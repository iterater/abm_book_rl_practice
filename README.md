# Practice textbook on reinforcement learning

This is a repository for textbook **"Selected topics in reinforcement learning: practical hands-on"** presenting practical hands on in selected topics on reinforcement learning. The book is designed with [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html). The equal content is presented with:
- [online published version](https://iterater.github.io/education/rl_practice/)
- [published PDF version](build_results/book_published_v1.pdf)
- this repo (see Content below), **NB:** some notebook content is optimized to JupyterBook, so the above options are recommended
