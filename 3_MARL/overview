  - Master ABM environment construction and local perception mechanisms  
  - Observe self-organized thermal distribution phenomena under simple rules  

2. Classic Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
   - Core Content: [simple_MARL.ipynb]
  - Learning Objectives:  
  - Understand classical Markov game-based multi-agent reinforcement learning  
  - Analyze cooperative/competitive behavior patterns in multi-agent systems  

3. HeatBug+RL Integration: Individual Decision Enhancement 
   - Core Content: [simple_heatbug+MARL.ipynb]
  - Learning Objectives:
